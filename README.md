# Coverage Path Planning: The Boustrophedon Cellular Decomposition

Implements a Coverage Path Planning (CPP) simulation using the Boustrophedon Cellular Decomposition (BCD) algorithm. It allows a mobile robot to efficiently cover an entire workspace while avoiding obstacles.

## Coverage Path Planning

fundamental problem in mobile robotics that focuses on generating a path to ensure that a robot visits every point within a defined workspace while avoiding obstacles. Unlike traditional point-to-point navigation, the goal of CPP is to achieve complete area coverage, meaning that the robot‚Äôs sensor or tool footprint passes over all accessible regions of the environment at least once. This approach is widely applied in various domains such as cleaning robots, agricultural field coverage, inspection, and mapping. A well-designed CPP algorithm must balance completeness, efficiency, and redundancy minimization, ensuring that the robot covers all target areas with minimal overlap and travel distance.

## Boustrophedon Cellular Decomposition

A method used in Coverage Path Planning (CPP) for mobile robots to ensure complete and systematic coverage of a given workspace. The term boustrophedon derives from the Greek expression meaning ‚Äúthe way of the ox turns while plowing‚Äù, symbolizing a back-and-forth sweeping motion. In this approach, the environment is represented as an occupancy grid, and a sweep line is moved across the map to detect changes in free-space connectivity caused by obstacles. Each time a connectivity change is detected, a new cell is formed, resulting in a decomposition of the workspace into non-overlapping subregions that can be individually covered.
